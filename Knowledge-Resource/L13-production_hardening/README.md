# Lesson 13: Make your system production-grade
    - observable, safe, fast and resilient, tracing, rate-limits, batching, canaries, fallbacks, and cost controls 



0) goals

    - observability: metrics, logs, traces for every request
    - SLOs: set and enforce p95 latency, error budget
    - resilience: timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks
    - scale: batching, queues, autoscaling knobs
    - safety & privacy: redaction, PII handling, abuse controls
    - release hygiene: canaries, A/B, shadow traffic, rollbacks
    - cost control: token budgets, caching, dynamic routing
