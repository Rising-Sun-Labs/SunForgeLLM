# Practice: 

    - Implement processors and samplers; expose params in your API.
    - Add beam and contrastive endpoints/flags; unit test with fixed seeds.
    - Add speculative path using your smallest LM as draft; measure speedup.
    - Add stop sequences, bad word list, and anti-loop; write 3 golden tests.
    - Record a decoding matrix (grid of settings) on your eval set; keep the best defaults.
